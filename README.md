# Cdist examples

cdist is a configuration management system: https://www.cdi.st/

## Introduction
I migrated all of my personal infra to ansible and abandoned cdist.
This repo contains various cdist types that I managed to clean up for publishing.

I wrote quite a few manifests and types for specific environments, unfortunately bad coding practices hold me back from publishing those.
I'm a sysadmin not a developer.

## Usage

Drop these into your 'types' folder and reference them from your manifests.
Options should be pretty self-explanatory.

## Thanks

I would like to thank one of my mentors who introduced me to cdist and gave valuable feedback.

Also ungleich GmbH for this awesome tool and many examples they themselves published.
